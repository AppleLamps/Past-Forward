# New Features Added to Past Forward

This document describes the new features added to Past Forward: Gallery/History, ZIP Export, and Batch Upload.

## 1. Gallery/History Feature with IndexedDB

### Overview

Users can now save their generation results to browser storage and view them later in a gallery interface.

### Files Added

- **`lib/indexedDBUtils.ts`** - IndexedDB database utilities for storing and retrieving generations

### Key Features

- **Load from History**: Click "Load" to restore a generation and view its results
- **Delete Individual**: Remove specific generations from history
- **Clear All**: Delete all saved generations at once
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Blob URLs are properly cleaned up to prevent memory leaks

### Database Schema

```typescript
interface GenerationRecord {
    id: string;                          // Unique identifier
    timestamp: number;                   // Creation time
    originalImageUrl: string;            // Original uploaded image
    generatedImages: Record<string, string>; // Decade -> blob URL mapping
    metadata?: {
        fileName?: string;               // Original filename
        notes?: string;                  // User notes
    };
}
```

### Usage

```typescript
import { saveGeneration, getAllGenerations, deleteGeneration } from './lib/indexedDBUtils';

// Save a generation
await saveGeneration(record);

// Get all generations (sorted by newest first)
const records = await getAllGenerations();

// Delete a specific generation
await deleteGeneration(id);
```

## 2. ZIP Export Feature

### Overview

Users can now download all generated images as a single ZIP file for easy sharing and backup.

### Files Added

- **`lib/zipExportUtils.ts`** - ZIP creation and download utilities

- **Automatic Download**: ZIP file is automatically downloaded to user's device
- **Error Handling**: Graceful error handling if image processing fails

### Usage

```typescript
import { createAndDownloadZip } from './lib/zipExportUtils';

// Create and download ZIP in one step
await createAndDownloadZip(generatedImages, 'my-generations');

// Or create ZIP without downloading
const zipBlob = await createZipExport(generatedImages);
```

### UI Integration

- **Download ZIP Button**: Available on results screen alongside "Download Album"
- **Toast Notifications**: User feedback during ZIP creation
- **Disabled State**: Button is disabled while processing

## 5. Integration Points

### App State Management

```typescript
// New state variables
const [showGallery, setShowGallery] = useState(false);
const [isBatchMode, setIsBatchMode] = useState(false);
const [batchItems, setBatchItems] = useState<BatchItem[]>([]);
const [batchProgress, setBatchProgress] = useState(0);
const [isProcessingBatch, setIsProcessingBatch] = useState(false);
```

### New Handlers

- `handleBatchUpload()` - Process multiple files
- `handleDownloadZip()` - Create and download ZIP
- `saveToHistory()` - Save current generation
- `handleSelectFromGallery()` - Load saved generation

### Exports

- `DECADE_PROMPTS` - Now exported from `useImageGeneration` hook
- `generateDecadeImage` - Already exported from `geminiService`

{
  "jszip": "^3.x.x"
}
```

## 8. Testing Recommendations

### Gallery/History

1. Generate a photo
2. Click "Save" button
3. Click "Gallery" button
4. Verify generation appears in grid
5. Click "Load" to restore
6. Click "Delete" to remove
7. Click "Clear All" to remove all

### ZIP Export

1. Generate a photo
2. Click "Download ZIP" button
3. Verify ZIP file downloads
4. Extract and verify all 6 images are present

### Batch Upload

1. Toggle "Batch Mode" button
2. Select 3-5 photos
3. Watch progress bars update
4. Verify all images are saved to history
5. Check gallery for all new generations

---

## 9. Performance Considerations

### Memory Usage

- Blob URLs are ~70% more efficient than base64
- Automatic cleanup prevents memory leaks
- Sequential image loading in batch mode reduces memory peaks

### Storage

- Each generation: ~2-5MB (6 images)
- IndexedDB quota: Usually 50MB+
- Users can clear history to free space

### Processing Time

- Single image: ~10-30 seconds (6 parallel requests)
- Batch of 5 images: ~50-150 seconds (sequential processing)
- ZIP creation: ~2-5 seconds

- Cloud storage integration (Google Drive, Dropbox)
- Sharing links for gallery items
- Batch export to ZIP
- Image annotations/notes
- Favorites/starred generations
- Search and filter history
- Export to PDF with metadata
- Social media sharing buttons
